  <section name="What is James Protocols?">

    <p>The Apache James Protocols Project delivers a lightweight, 
       and highly extensible framework for mail protocols implementations.</p>
       
    <p>The framework was build as a generic one, so its not bound to any socket implementation. 
       This make it possible to use it with NIO or IO Frameworks.</p>
       
  </section>
       
  <section name="James Protocols used by James Server">
 
    <p>The framework is currently used by James Server in conjunction with NETTY to provide a 
       high performant and extensible SMTP Server.</p>
       
    <p>At the moment only the SMTP protocol is included, but others will follow.</p>
       
    <p>You can read more about protocols used for SMTP in James Server on the <a href="../server/3/dev-extend-hook-smtp.html">SMTP Hooks</a> page.</p>
