  <section name="What is JAMES Protocols?">

    <p>The Apache JAMES Protocols Project delivers a lightweight, 
       and highly extensible framework for mail protocols implementations. 
       The framework was build as a generic one, so its not bound to any socket implementation. 
       This make it possible to use it with NIO or IO Frameworks.</p>
       
    <p>The framework is currently used by JAMES Server in conjunction with NETTY to provide a 
       high performant and extensible SMTP Server. 
       At the moment only the SMTP protocol is included, but others will follow.</p>
       
    <p>You can read more about SMTP protocols usage in James Server on the <a href="../server/head/concept_smtp_hooks.html">SMTP Hooks</a> page.</p>

    <p>Apache JAMES is a project of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) which 
       encourages a collaborative, consensus-based development process under an open software license.</p>

    <p>The ASF maintains other Java projects which may also be of interest. 
        These are detailed on the ASF Projects page.</p>

    <p>We recommended that users of JAMES products subscribe to the 
       JAMES users mailing list.</p>
