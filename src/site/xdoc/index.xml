  <section name="What is James Protocols?">

    <p>The Apache James Protocols Project delivers a lightweight, 
       and highly extensible framework for mail protocols implementations.</p>
       
    <p>The framework was build as a generic one, so its not bound to any socket implementation. 
       This make it possible to use it with NIO or IO Frameworks.</p>
